the x86-only runtime instead (build-x86.sh), for trying it: 32-bit programs

the DLL repository's (horizon-dlls), which the package is checked against."""

============

1. Copy your own WarCraft III installation into switch/wine/drive_c/WarCraft III,

2. Run war3-setup.exe once from the launcher and wait for it to finish. Run it
   again after changing the resolution in the game's options.
3. Start war3.exe through a forwarder set to a 36-bit or 39-bit address space.
   With 32-bit its DLL layout changes from launch to launch and Game.dll
   sometimes fails to load.

The setup writes each step as a [WAR3 SETUP] line in autorun_runtime.log,
ending with "done, all steps worked":
- the game's video settings: 1280x720, 32-bit colour, 60 Hz, the Switch's own
  screen, where the pointer and the touchscreen are;
- the intro movie plays at startup;
- the game draws with its own OpenGL renderer, which takes about half the CPU
  its Direct3D does through Wine (a war3.args.txt holding -opengl next to
  war3.exe does the same for one launch);
- only the 1280x720 display mode is offered, so the movies fill the width.

The movies play through DirectShow, which Autorun registers before the first
program on the card.

(sims2 / 'README.txt').write_text('''The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection
==============================

Copy the collection onto the card -- leave __Installer and Support behind, they
are for a computer -- and run sims2-setup.exe once from the launcher. It writes
what the release's own "Instalar Registros" batch file writes, with the card's
paths, and says what it did in autorun_runtime.log as [SIMS2 SETUP] lines.
Running it again is harmless.

Where the packs go does not matter much. Each one is recognised by the
executable in its TSBin, not by the name of the folder around it, so a release
that calls them Base and EP1-EP9 and one that spells out "The Sims 2 Nightlife"
both work, and the collection may keep a folder of its own around them. Put
sims2-setup.exe's folder beside the packs, or beside the folder holding them.

The setup also copies dxvk.conf from its folder into each pack's TSBin, next to
the executable. It holds the game to 512 MB of video memory: DXVK's own profile
for The Sims 2 reports 2 GB, and on the Switch the game fills the shared 1.5 GB
and crashes. A dxvk.conf already in TSBin is left as it is.

It also sets the game's own Graphics Rules.sgr (TSData\\Res\\Config in each pack)
for the Switch's 1280x720 screen: in its screen resolution option every default
becomes 1280x720, and a maximum below that is raised to it. Nothing else in the
file changes, and the file as it was is kept as Graphics Rules.sgr.original.

The game is the newest expansion's executable, TSBin\\Sims2EP9.exe. It has no
relocations and is linked for 0x400000, so it requires the 39-bit Autorun
forwarder and the Atmosphere low-address patch.

The game's own movies -- the intro, the EA logo, what plays on a television --
are .movie files in Maxis' own format, which the game reads itself: they need no
codec and nothing registered.

VP6 is for the video the game writes rather than the video it reads. It records
gameplay through Video for Windows (AVIStreamWrite and ICSeqCompressFrame are
what Sims2EP9.exe imports), and a custom video made as a VP6 AVI is read the
same way. The codec is the release's to supply and nobody else's to give away:
copy __Installer\\customcomponent\\vp6\\vp6vfw.dll into C:\\windows\\syswow64 on
the card if you want either. The setup registers it under both the names Video
for Windows opens it by, whether or not the file is there.

The language number does two things: the game reads it, and so does the
release's own launcher emulation, which anadius.cfg points at a key of its own
by setting its language to "invalid". The setup writes both. Getting only the
first is how the game comes up saying "open: Invalid handle" and stops.

For a language other than English, put its number in language.txt beside
sims2-setup.exe before running it:

================

Copy the switch folder to the SD card, merging folders; it replaces the runtime
NRO of any earlier build. The Windows DLLs are not in this archive: Autorun
downloads them itself (Settings, System, Windows DLLs), or copy the switch
folder of autorun-horizon-dlls' release the same way.

The launcher lists the programs in drive_c. Games that need something more:

WarCraft III: see drive_c/WarCraft III Setup/README.txt.

The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection: see drive_c/The Sims 2 Setup/README.txt.

Guitar Hero III: run gh3-setup.exe from the game's folder once.

Need for Speed Underground 2 and Most Wanted: neither executable can be moved in
memory, so start them through a forwarder set to a 32-bit address space.

Fallout New Vegas (GOG): its executable relocates, so it needs no forwarder.
Started with no settings of its own the game hands itself to
FalloutNVLauncher.exe and closes, so the archive brings the settings file it
would have written:

    C:\\users\\steamuser\\Documents\\My Games\\FalloutNV\\FalloutPrefs.ini

It names the Switch's GPU as DXVK reports it, at 1280x720. The game rewrites
that file once its own options are used; if it already holds settings worth
keeping, keep the [Display] sD3DDevice line and merge the rest.

Halo: Combat Evolved: delete the ._ files a Mac leaves beside every file on the
card if the game was copied from one: Halo loads every DLL in its Controls
folder and one of those is not a DLL. Halo walks with w, a, s and d and works
its menus with the arrows, so the left stick takes one set and the d-pad the
other. Put this beside HALO.EXE as HALO.keys.txt, which is applied over
keys.txt:

    LUP=0x57    w, forward: the left stick alone
    LDOWN=0x53  s
    LLEFT=0x41  a
    LRIGHT=0x44 d
    UP=0x26     the arrows, for the menus: the d-pad alone
    DOWN=0x28
    LEFT=0x25
    RIGHT=0x27
    X=0x0d      Enter, to choose a menu item
    Y=0x20      space, to jump
    L=0x45      e, the action key
    R=0x52      r, to reload
    ZL=0x11     left control, to crouch
    ZR=0x09     tab, the scores
    MINUS=0x1b  Escape, to go back

Left 4 Dead 2: left4dead2.exe relocates, so it needs no forwarder either.
Steam's GameOverlayRenderer.dll not loading is expected and harmless.

Settings: switch/wine/config/settings.json holds every one of them, and
config/keys.txt the keys the controller sends. Both are set from the launcher
(Settings, Defaults, Controls, and a program's own Controls row), so neither
has to be written by hand.

Logs: switch/wine/logs/autorun_runtime.log holds the last run.
